    <h1>Scarlet Tales : Part 2</h1>
    <p>
The bells ring once again, reminding us it’s time to celebrate you and another 
incredible year of your journey. This year marks not just the passing of time, 
but all the beautiful moments, memories, and dreams that make you who you are. 
I’m endlessly grateful to walk this path beside you—to laugh with you, grow with you, 
and love you a little more with each passing year.

This is just a small something to cheer you up and remind you how truly special you are. 
You do so many amazing things for me every single day, often without even realizing it. 
So today, in my own little way, I want to do something for you — to show you how much you mean to me.
