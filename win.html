      I know the most valuable aspect of your life is your academic achievements. You want to make a mark 
      wherever you go but you are troubled when other people (who have scored less than you) succeed.
      <br>
      As your partner, I can only tell you that we have our unique trajectories in life and comparison 
      will kill us from inside so here is a story for you which I think will help you go through this year. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Once there was a man who felt very sad because his hard work never seemed to give results. 
      One day, he went to the forest and met a wise hermit. 
      <br>The man asked, “Why should I not give up?”
      The hermit showed him two plants — a fern and a Chinese bamboo.
      <br>
      He said, “I planted both at the same time and gave them water and care every day. The fern grew quickly, but the bamboo did not grow at all for many years.”
      <br>
      The man was surprised.
      <br>
      Then the hermit smiled and said, “In the fifth year, the bamboo suddenly grew very tall — almost as tall as a building!”
      <br>
      The man asked, “Why did it take so long?”
      The hermit replied, “Because the bamboo was growing strong roots under the ground first.”
      <br>
      The man understood the lesson — sometimes we grow on the inside before others can see it.
      He felt happy and went back to live his life with hope.
      <br>
      Just because you don’t see results quickly doesn’t mean you’re not growing.
      Keep trying — your roots are getting stronger.
